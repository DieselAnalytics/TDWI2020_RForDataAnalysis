# R for Data Analysis

This repo contains the information covered in the ***R for Data Analysis*** workshop. The Jupyter Notebooks used in the workshop are listed below complete with descriptions:

**DataAnalysisWitthR-Setup.ipynb**:  Jupyter Notebook that contains the information covered in the ***Setup*** module.
**DataAnalysisWithR-DataViz.ipynb**:  Jupyter Notebook that contains the information covered in the ***Data Visualization*** module.
**DataAnalysisWithR-AtomicVectors.ipynb**:  Jupyter Notebook that contains the information covered in the ***Atomic Vectors*** module.
**DataAnalysisWithR-DataWrangling.ipynb**:  Jupyter Notebook that contains the information covered in the ***Data Wrangling*** module.
**DataAnalysisWithR-MachineLearning.ipynb**:  Jupyter Notebook that contains the information covered in the ***Machine Learning*** module.

The Jupyter Notebooks listed above are perfect for teaching and sharing your code with others because of ***Markdown***. ***Markdown*** enables you to easily add rich text to your Jupyter Notebook making it easier to describe the intent and results of your analysis. A traditonal ***R script*** may be a better medium to execute code if that is all you want to do. Given that, I created ***R scripts*** that contains the same code that are in the Jupyter Notebooks. The have the same names so you can use the descriptions used for the Jupyter Notebooks with the same name to learn about what is covered in the ***R Scripts***. The scripts are warehoused in the ***Scripts*** folder.
